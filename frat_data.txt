Fraternity and Sorority Life is a dynamic community of 1,000+ members. The community comprises more
than 40 national and international fraternities and sororities. These organizations contribute to campus
life and surrounding communities by hosting educational, service, and social events. They set high
academic standards and provide opportunities for campus involvement, networking, and leadership
development.

Each semester we update each chapter's scorecard with information about the chapter, awards received,
and the chapter's health - based off of self-reported information and institutional data, Chapter
scorecards are available through the the Chapters & Council section
