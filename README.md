Inspiration
The inspiration for your project might stem from a question like, "How do I navigate through the overwhelming process of university selection and preparation?" Almost every high school student faces the daunting task of choosing the right university and preparing for it. It's a journey filled with questions about academic programs, campus life, financial aid, and career prospects. Recognizing this, you might have thought, what if there was a platform that not only provides essential information about GMU but also offers personalized guidance and insights to make this journey less overwhelming and more informed?
What it does
The website offers tailored advice to prospective GMU students. Through interactive questionnaires and tools, it helps students align their academic interests, career aspirations, and personal preferences with what GMU has to offer.

It includes features to assist students in understanding and planning for the financial aspects of university education. This could involve information on tuition fees, living expenses, financial aid options, and scholarship opportunities specific to GMU.

The platform showcases facilities, student life, and academic departments. This feature aims to give students a feel of the university environment from the comfort of their homes.

The website details GMUâ€™s academic programs, courses, and extracurricular activities, helping students make informed decisions about their field of study and interests. It simplifies the admissions process by providing step-by-step guidance, important dates, document checklists, and tips for preparing a strong application.

The site keeps prospective students in the loop with the latest news, events, and important deadlines from GMU, ensuring they never miss out on vital information.

How we built it
Challenges we ran into
Creating a sophisticated website requires knowledge in web development, including proficiency in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and potentially back-end languages like Python or PHP.

We had a hard time navigating through Azure and its vast majority of services it had to offer. The cloud availability was down in peak hours and we faced a lot of issues through it

Through Azure, we spent a lot of time in the function app as a service.

For Taipy, we had a huge lack of resources.

Conducting thorough user testing to identify and fix bugs, and to improve the overall user experience. Also, Gathering and effectively integrating user feedback into website improvements.
